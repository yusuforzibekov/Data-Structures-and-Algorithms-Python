# Priority Queue. The Heap sort algorithm

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

* The priority queue data structure as an API on top of a heap
* The heap sort algorithm

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Implementing a basic priority queue API
* Implementing the heap sort algorithm
* Supporting an infinite set with the `pop_minimum` and `insert` operations
