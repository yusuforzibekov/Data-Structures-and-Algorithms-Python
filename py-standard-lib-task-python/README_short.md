# [Python] Standard library overview

## Purpose

These coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:

- Operating system-related modules of the standard library (e.g., `os`, `pathlib`, `glob`)
- Runtime-related modules of the standard library (e.g., `sys`, `argparse`)
- File format-related modules of the standard library (e.g., `csv`, `json`, `zipfile`)
- Mathematical modules of the standard library (e.g., `math`, `random`)
- Date and time-related modules of the standard library (e.g., `datetime`, `time`, `timeit`)
- Advanced iterators and data structures provided by the standard library (e.g., by `itertools`, `collections`)

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:

- Print directory tree
- Convert CSV to JSON
- Calculate biorhythm
