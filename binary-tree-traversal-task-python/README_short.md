# Binary Tree Traversal

## Purpose

The following coding exercises are designed to test your knowledge of the following concepts:
* Binary tree
* Binary tree traversals (inorder, postorder, preorder, level order)

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Checking whether two binary trees are identical
* Getting the inorder traversal for a given binary tree
* Getting the postorder traversal for a given binary tree
* Getting the preorder traversal for a given binary tree
* Getting the level order traversal for a given binary tree
